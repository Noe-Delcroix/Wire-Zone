# Wire Zone

This program is a tool that allows you to build and interact with logic circuits.
You can place logic gates, switches and connect them with wires to build your own computer.


## How to use
Left click to place, right click to remove, scroll wheel to rotate blocks.
Hold shift to move the camera and zoom in and out.
Once you've placed components on the board, you can enter edit mode by pressing the space bar
The mode allows you to make selection by dragging the mouse.
In these selections, you can see the inputs (circles) and outputs (triangles) of each block.
You can also click on inputs/outputs to change them (don't do that, it is still in development so it breaks everything)
In edit mode, you can also use your regular controls to copy, cut, delete and paste selections.

This project runs on JavaScript using the p5.js library.
